    <p> I’m dyslexic. It has been a battle; I’ve been mocked for not being able to read aloud or for asking “stupid” questions, questions which I should have known the answers to if I had just read the book. However I did read the book, more carefully and more times than any of the other students. Since everyone made fun of me I was labeled the “different one” the odd one out.  I didn’t have very many friends and the people I was friends with, I would try my absolute best to hide the fact that I couldn’t read well. I would ask to go to the bathroom if they were reading aloud and I would never go up to the board to spell anything. I was afraid I would lose friends because I had to sing a song to spell “ocean” (Orcas Can Eat All Night). Even the school system thought it was best for me to get held back a year. If it wasn’t for my mother pushing for me to be tested, no one would know that at the age of 8, I had a listening comprehension of a 21-year-old but I was in the 16th percentile for decoding.
        Being “different” also leads me to try things others might not. In the eighth grade, I decided I wanted to try out for the wrestling team; the coaches have never had a girl on the team before and I had never tried wrestling. The coaches had no gear for a girl and when I went with the team to matches at different schools, I had to get changed in the bathroom and wait outside the boys’ locker room for my team because the girls’ locker room would be locked. It was understandable; not many girls want to throw around other sweaty boys. I was one of the girls who didn’t care. I knew what I was capable of: I know how to flip a person over my shoulder and pin him (or her!) down. Eventually, I wanted to try something similar to wrestling which would complement my karate(Okinawan Kempo) background. That is when I discovered Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. It mixed perfectly with Okinawan Kempo, and the only problem was that I was the only woman again.
        Being the “odd” one did take some getting used to. After hearing statements like,“ You need to cover up, I can see your sports bra in the back, and you don’t belong here.” Statements like these made me rethink my mindset, something flipped in my head. I became more determined to prove them wrong. Joining the wrestling team and then going on to do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has given me the willpower to keep pushing myself.
        Joining these two sports not only gave me the drive to prove that I can do anything but also gave me the motivation to work around my dyslexia. I have become more confident in my actions, I ask how to spell words, try to read aloud as well as go up to the board to write an answer. I still don’t correct people’s spelling; it would be a bit too ironic and no one wants to hear me sing.
        Having a disability makes me look at people from a different perspective: I understand what they're telling me, whether they deliver the message as an interpretive dance or a 15-page Powerpoint. It allows me to read between the lines, to see below the surface of the OCEAN.
